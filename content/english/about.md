My name is Luiz, I am passionate about solving problems and I love the flexibility I have for this in the technology area. I believe that both life and a company are summarized in the choices that are made, and the data ensures that the best decision is made. That is why I seek improvement in data science, data analytics and machine learning, with the aim of generating important insights for the company's future. Currently studying computer science at Faculdade Impacta de Tecnologia.

My skill set includes:
- Statistics Knowledge
- Python (Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Keras, Flask, Streamlit)
- R (Tidyverse)
- SQL (MySQL, SQLServer, PostgreSQL)
- NoSql (MongoDB, HBase)
- Power BI
- Big Data (Hadoop Ecosystem)
