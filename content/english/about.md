My name is Luiz, I am passionate about solving problems and I love the flexibility that I have for doing that in the technology area.

I believe that both life and a company can be represented by the choices that are made, and working with data ensures that the best decision will be taken. That is the reason why I seek improvement in data science, data analytics and machine learning, with the aim of generating important insights for the company's future.

I am currently studying computer science at Faculdade Impacta de Tecnologia.

My skill set:
- Statistics Knowledge
- Python (Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Keras, Flask, Streamlit)
- R (Tidyverse)
- SQL (MySQL, SQLServer, PostgreSQL)
- NoSql (MongoDB, HBase)
- Power BI
- Big Data (Hadoop Ecosystem)
